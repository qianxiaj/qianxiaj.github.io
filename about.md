Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington (Seattle), working as a research assistant in the Mechatronics, Automation, and Control System ([MACS](https://depts.washington.edu/xchenlab/)) Lab. 

My passion is robotics and automation. I have an academic foundation in controls, estimation, optimization and machine learning. My research focused on control of robotics system under slow and delayed sensors. 

In 2015, I received my bachelor's degree from **Tsinghua University** (Beijing, China) and joined **University of Connecticut** (Storrs, USA) towards a Ph.D program. In 2019 Summer, I was a research scientist intern at **Amazon DEX team**. In 2019 Setember, I transfered to **University of Washington** (seattle, USA) along with my Ph.D advisor and the research lab.


## Projects
#### Research Projects
- **Target Following under Slow and Delayed Visual Feedback** (**[details](../target-tracking)**)
    - An enhanced visual servo algorithm for tracking targets with fast-dynamics movement, but the vision feedback is slow and delayed.
    - The Algorithm was tested in a robot platform with two arms (Universal UR3 manipulator) and eye-in-hand cameras.
- **Collaborative Sensing for Real-time Recovery of Fast Data Flows from Sparse Measurements**
    - An online information recovery algorithm that can reconstruct a densely sampled measurements from two sparse sensor measurements.

#### Course Projects
- **Toro-Tile-Straight AI Agent**
    - An AI agent player for the Toro-Tile-Straight game using the minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, Zobrist hashing techniques.
    - Ranked **2/85** in the AI vs AI competition in class.
- **IMM Estimator for Air Traffic Control**
    - On-line estimation of the position, velocity, and course of an airplane from radar measurements using the interacting multiple model (IMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- **Semantic Image Segmentation for Airplanes using CNN** (**[video](https://youtu.be/1U0jFizfeNI)**)
    - A 27-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net structure that can segment airplanes in an image. (Keywords: Deep learning, Image processing)

#### For Fun

- **Automated Rubik's Cube Robot Solver** (**[video](https://youtu.be/Kjj0HcvhKNU)**)
    - A dual-arm robot that can automatically inspect and solve (physically) a random scrambled Rubik's cube.
- **Pose Estimation For Human Upper Limb and Control of Robotics Arm and Hand** (**[video](https://youtu.be/knHSEhblEnU)**)
    - An upper arm posture estimation algorithm by fusion measurements from three wearable IMUs and five resistive flex sensors. The algorithm is used to remotely control a robotic arm and hand.
